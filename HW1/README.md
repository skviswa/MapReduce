Following are the instructions to build run and test the program:

1. The class Data contains the main method
2. It takes one input, which is the weather data file. 
3. Add the input file to the src folder. I have attached an example 3.3 KB file showing the same.
4. Example argument: src/1722.csv
5. The program implements all 5 versions of the problem set, and prints the result, averaged over 10 Runs.
6. There is an optional input, to enable the Fibonacci function.
7. To implement and check this version, provide an extra argument true or false(enabling or disabling Fibonacci(17) term.
8. Example arguement: src/1722.csv true. 
9. By default, the arguement is false.
